# flipper_badusb_DB
this is where i store all of the plaloads for the BAD usb flipper 

I have no clue how to use github. the only reson i made this was so i could download the files off the internet using my flippers badsub function.

all of the .txt file you see are diffrent BADUSB attacks. (the names mostly do not corespond to the typeof payload so just read the code or sm i dong care)
in addtion many of the .PY files (or other files) are the payloads I want to download only on the computer of the "test subject" then run them using the flipper.
